# L2 Orchestrator Offline Playbook - Banking SOC

Source files used as authority:
- `mitre-attack-kb/mitre_attack_full.json`
- `mitre-attack-kb/mitre_attack_full.md`

This playbook is designed for an L2 SOC orchestrator that has no internet access. The orchestrator must use verified evidence, the offline MITRE ATT&CK KB, this playbook, and reasoning over attacker progression to decide what to contain, what to hunt, what to queue for approval, and what to monitor next.

## 1. Operating Contract

1. Treat Layer 1 mappings as hypotheses until verified against raw evidence.
2. Use only facts that are present in the alert, raw logs, local telemetry, or the offline MITRE KB.
3. Never invent users, hosts, IP addresses, event IDs, transaction IDs, or tool results.
4. Parent/subtechnique matching is mandatory. If `T1003.001` is verified, route it as both `T1003.001` and parent `T1003`. If only parent `T1003` is verified, keep all child-specific actions conditional until child evidence is known.
5. Technique routing and tactic routing are separate. A technique may be useful in a playbook even when its official tactic is different, but the rationale must say why the behavior fits that playbook.
6. If no technique matches but behavior is abnormal, route to `PB-ANOMALY`; absence of known MITRE mapping is not absence of attack.
7. Execute only low/medium impact actions marked `AUTO`. Queue all high impact, critical impact, service-disruptive, customer notification, regulator notification, SWIFT, HSM, Core Banking, and DR actions for approval.
8. Preserve evidence before disruptive containment when feasible.
9. Every action must be recorded with priority, target, approval mode, status, timestamp, and playbook source.
10. Use the predictive flow after every confirmed or partially confirmed alert: current technique -> MITRE `prediction_chains` -> same CAPEC/CWE family -> next kill-chain phase -> banking blast radius.

## 2. Normalization For Playbook Matching

The orchestrator should construct this internal matching object before route selection:

```json
{
  "verified_techniques": ["T1003.001"],
  "expanded_techniques": ["T1003.001", "T1003"],
  "verified_tactics": ["TA0006"],
  "domains": ["enterprise", "cloud", "mobile", "ics"],
  "banking_flags": {
    "swift_or_payment_involved": false,
    "core_banking_involved": false,
    "customer_data_involved": false,
    "atm_or_hsm_involved": false,
    "privileged_identity_involved": false,
    "backup_or_recovery_involved": false,
    "security_control_involved": false,
    "fraud_control_involved": false
  },
  "entities": {},
  "evidence": {},
  "verification_state": "confirmed|not_confirmed|contradicted|insufficient|not_required",
  "verification_strength": "strong|supported|weak|none|contradicted"
}
```

Matching order:

1. Expand every verified subtechnique to its parent using the offline KB.
2. Match high priority banking playbooks first.
3. Match exact technique and parent technique triggers.
4. Match tactic fallback when no specific playbook trigger exists.
5. Apply banking sensitivity override.
6. Add `PB-ANOMALY` if the behavior is abnormal but no known technique is verified.
7. Activate multiple playbooks when the evidence supports multiple attacker objectives.

## 3. Response Modes And Approval

| Mode | Use When | Default Action Bias |
|------|----------|---------------------|
| `MONITOR` | Recon, resource development, weak evidence, blocked attack | Increase logging, add watchlists, create hunts |
| `CONTAIN` | Initial access, execution, persistence, confirmed compromise with limited blast radius | Stop active execution, isolate user workstation if allowed, preserve evidence |
| `CONTAIN_AND_HUNT` | Privilege escalation, stealth, credential access, discovery, lateral movement, collection, C2 | Contain confirmed nodes, hunt laterally, revoke confirmed compromised credentials |
| `CRISIS` | Impact, exfiltration, financial theft, destructive activity, confirmed customer data exposure, critical banking system risk | Evidence preservation, business escalation, queue critical controls, execute safe auto-controls |

Approval rules:

| Action Class | Approval Mode |
|--------------|---------------|
| Add IOC/watchlist, raise monitoring, create temporary detection/hunt | `AUTO` |
| Block known malicious IP/domain with strong Layer 2 verification and narrow scope | `AUTO` |
| WAF virtual patch scoped to exploit pattern | `AUTO` |
| Reset one confirmed compromised password | `AUTO` |
| Disable one confirmed compromised account | `AUTO` |
| Kill verified malicious process | `AUTO` |
| Isolate user workstation with active compromise | `AUTO` |
| Isolate server or shared service | `APPROVAL_REQUIRED` |
| Freeze payments, disconnect SWIFT, isolate Core Banking, HSM, ATM switch, or VLAN | `MANUAL_ONLY` |
| Notify regulator, SWIFT, card network, customer, law enforcement | `MANUAL_ONLY` |
| Activate DR or mass password reset | `MANUAL_ONLY` |

Risk score action gate:

| Final Risk Score | Required Handling |
|------------------|-------------------|
| `0.0-6.0` | Monitor, preserve, hunt, or request more evidence according to verification state. Do not auto-contain only because Layer 1 alerted. |
| `>6.0` | Execute all available non-disruptive SOC actions: preserve logs/evidence, raise monitoring, add scoped watchlists or temporary detections, create hunt tasks, open/update SOC ticket, and notify SOC. |
| `>6.0` **AND** all auto-containment gate conditions met: (1) `threat_confirmed=true`, (2) `l2_independent_verification.performed=true`, (3) `verification_state="confirmed"`, (4) `verification_strength` is `supported` or `strong`, (5) `opa_result="allow"`, (6) SOC Autopilot ON, (7) current time inside execution window (default 08:00-20:00 Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh), (8) action is low/medium impact + scoped + time-bound + reversible + non-manual-only, (9) rollback support exists, (10) confirmed behavior is high-fidelity and dangerous now, (11) action is narrowly targeted to verified entity | Execute eligible containment: scoped IP block, WAF virtual patch, force logout, host quarantine, limited network control, or access revocation. |
| Any score with manual-only target or high business-impact action | Queue for approval or manual escalation. Never automatically isolate SWIFT, Core Banking, HSM, ATM switch, critical VLAN, DR, broad services, external notifications, destructive cleanup, or data deletion. |

Layer 1 vote count, worker count, or worker confidence must not be used as an action gate. A single Layer 1 positive finding can lead to action when Layer 2 independently verifies the case and the gate above passes.

## 4. Banking Sensitivity Override

| Banking Condition | Minimum Mode | Required Handling |
|-------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Confirmed SWIFT/payment manipulation or financial theft | `CRISIS` | Queue transaction freeze and SWIFT/payment operations approval path |
| SWIFT/payment system touched but fraud not confirmed | `CONTAIN_AND_HUNT` | Preserve transaction evidence and monitor payment queues |
| Core Banking touched | `CONTAIN_AND_HUNT` | Queue service-impacting actions; no automatic segment isolation |
| Customer data confirmed exposed or staged | `CRISIS` | Legal/compliance assessment required |
| Customer data at risk but not confirmed exposed | `CONTAIN_AND_HUNT` | DLP/hunt and data access audit |
| ATM/HSM/payment hardware touched | `CONTAIN`; `CRISIS` for impact, inhibit response, impair process, destructive behavior, cash integrity, or key integrity risk | Escalate to operations and physical security; HSM isolation is manual only |
| Privileged identity involved | `CONTAIN` | Confirm compromise before disable/reset; expand hunt to admin sessions |
| Backup/recovery touched | `CONTAIN_AND_HUNT` | Verify immutable backups and queue DR readiness review |
| Security control impaired | `CONTAIN_AND_HUNT` | Restore control, preserve tamper evidence, hunt for impact prep |

## 7. Playbook Library

Each playbook follows this action sequence: verify, preserve, contain, hunt, recover, predict.

### PB-INITIAL-ACCESS

Trigger: verified `TA0001` or `TA0027` initial access behavior that does not fit a more specific playbook.

Attacker objective: gain the first foothold through exposed service, phishing, valid account, drive-by, removable media, trusted relationship, or external remote service.

Immediate actions:
1. AUTO: preserve entry-vector evidence: email, WAF, VPN, SSO, endpoint, browser, API gateway, and network logs.
2. AUTO: add source IP/domain/account/device/user agent to watchlists.
3. AUTO: block Layer 2-verified malicious source or URL when scoped.
4. AUTO: create temporary hunts for execution, persistence, credential access, and C2 from the same entity.
5. APPROVAL_REQUIRED: queue server isolation or account restriction if the entry point is shared or business-critical.

Hunt and scope:
1. Identify entry vector and first successful execution or session.
2. Determine whether the attacker has code execution, valid credentials, SaaS session, or only attempted access.
3. Search for `T1059`, `T1105`, `T1547`, `T1505.003`, `T1003`, and `T1071`.

Hunt and scope:
1. Identify impact type: data destruction, data manipulation, account/resource abuse, defacement, shutdown, service stop, or operational disruption.
2. Search backward for initial access, credential access, lateral movement, collection, exfiltration, and defense impairment.
3. Verify backup integrity, transaction integrity, and customer/service impact.

Predict and mitigate:
1. Predict repeated impact, recovery inhibition, indicator removal, and fraud/exfiltration cover-up.
2. Apply or stage `M1053`, `M1040`, `M1030`, `M1031`, `M1047`, `M1057`, and `M1041`.

4. MANUAL_ONLY: queue transaction freeze, payment rail isolation, SWIFT workstation isolation, or reversal workflow through CISO, business owner, and Legal/Compliance.
5. MANUAL_ONLY: queue external notification to regulator, SWIFT, card network, correspondent bank, or customer.

Hunt and scope:
1. Compare beneficiary, amount, account, approval chain, source IP, device, session, and timestamp against baseline and approved workflow.
2. Search for preceding valid-account misuse, credential access, web exploit, C2, or defense impairment.
3. Verify transaction database integrity with before/after snapshots and reconciliation logs.
4. Identify whether fraud is single transaction, batch, recurring scheduled transfer, or systemic logic tampering.

Predict and mitigate:
1. Predict `T1070`, `T1485`, `T1003`, `T1021`, and `T1041`.
2. Apply or stage `M1018`, `M1032`, `M1030`, `M1047`, and `M1057`.

2. AUTO: reset one confirmed compromised password or revoke one confirmed compromised session/token.
3. AUTO: disable one confirmed compromised account when abuse is active and scoped.
4. AUTO: isolate workstation if active credential dumping is confirmed.
5. APPROVAL_REQUIRED: queue domain controller isolation, service account rotation, broad privileged credential rotation, or mass reset.

Hunt and scope:
1. If `T1003.001` is present, preserve LSASS evidence and verify Credential Guard/ASR status.

## 9. Evidence Preservation Checklist

Use the relevant items before disruptive action:

1. Identity: AD/IAM/SSO/MFA/PAM/VPN/Kerberos logs, session IDs, token IDs, account changes.
2. Endpoint: memory metadata, process tree, command lines, loaded modules, file paths, hashes, registry keys, services, scheduled tasks.
3. Network: firewall, proxy, DNS, NetFlow, packet samples, TLS metadata, NDR, VPN, IDS/IPS.
4. Application/API: WAF, API gateway, application logs, database audit, transaction workflow, fraud engine.
5. Data: DLP, database queries, object storage, file share, mailbox, cloud storage, repository logs.
6. Banking: SWIFT/payment gateway, Core Banking workflow, ATM switch, HSM audit, card/POS, reconciliation logs.
7. Control plane: EDR/AV policy, firewall rules, SIEM rules, cloud IAM, SaaS admin audit, CI/CD logs.
8. Physical/vendor: maintenance window, vendor session, terminal location, physical access, change ticket.

## 10. Regulatory And Escalation Routing

These are assessment triggers, not automatic external notifications.

| Condition | Internal Escalation | External Handling |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Confirmed customer personal data breach | CISO, Legal/Compliance, Data Protection owner | Legal/Compliance assesses Vietnam personal data obligations |
| Cardholder data breach | CISO, Legal/Compliance, Card program owner | Legal/Compliance and card program owner assess PCI/card brand path |
| SWIFT/payment fraud or manipulation | CEO, Board, CISO, CTO, Legal/Compliance, payment business owner | Regulator/SWIFT/correspondent handling only after approval |
| Core Banking compromise | CEO, Board, CISO, CTO, Core Banking owner, Legal/Compliance | Regulator liaison prepares assessment package |
| ATM/HSM/payment hardware compromise | CISO, Operations, Physical Security, Legal/Compliance | Law enforcement/regulator path requires approval |
| Service disruption affecting banking operations | CISO, CTO, Operations, Customer Support lead | Compliance assesses reporting threshold |

## 11. Quality Gates For Orchestrator Output

Before final L3 output, verify:

1. Every activated playbook has a verified technique, verified tactic, banking flag, or anomaly rationale.
2. Every technique ID in rationale exists in the offline KB.
3. Every action has approval mode and status.
4. Every queued action has approver and reason.
5. High/critical action is not marked `AUTO` unless a local emergency runbook explicitly allows it.
6. Parent/subtechnique expansion was applied.
7. Predictive defenses are present or explicitly empty with rationale.
8. Banking impact is assessed for SWIFT/payment, Core Banking, customer data, ATM/HSM, privileged identity, backup/recovery, and security controls.
9. Evidence preservation is listed before disruptive containment.
10. Regulatory assessment is separated from external notification.
11. If `final_risk_score_0_10 > 6.0`, output includes `decision.risk_response_floor.triggered=true` and every available non-disruptive floor action is present with `status="executed"` or a documented blocked/unavailable reason.
12. If an environment-changing action has `status="executed"`, OPA allow, SOC Autopilot ON, execution window, rollback support, scoped target, approval mode, and non-manual action class are all documented.
